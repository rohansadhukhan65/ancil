# My Next.js Project

This project is a Next.js application that uses MongoDB as the database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed locally or available on a cloud service

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**

   Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine or you have access to a cloud MongoDB instance.

4. **Create a `.env.local` file:**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project to store your environment variables.

5. **Copy the format from `example.env`:**

   ```bash
   cp example.env .env.local
   ```

6. **Edit the `.env.local` file:**

   Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:

   ```env
   # Example content for .env.local
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdatabase
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
